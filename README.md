# gdx-minesweeper
Minesweeper with libgdx and functional programming.

The core is totally functional and (I hope) well tested.

I was curious if I could make a program with
functions. Hope, I could.

I appreciate any thoughts, pull requests, remarks.

I did not take care of the UI, it is just for
proving that it works.
